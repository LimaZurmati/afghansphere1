## Project Management

### _GitHub Project Board_
Throughout my project management journey, I have leveraged the powerful features of GitHub Project Boards to effectively organize and enhance my latest initiative. It all started with a surge of creativity inspired by my carefully designed wireframe models. These models laid the groundwork for a series of detailed user stories, each acting as a vital component in bringing my project to fruition.

User stories go beyond mere descriptions; they offer a clear and logical framework for development, ensuring that the final product aligns closely with my vision. This intentional strategy helps maintain order and facilitates timely progress.

To reinforce this structure, I established milestones, particularly focusing on the frontend application. Milestones serve as crucial checkpoints, enabling me to monitor the project's progress in manageable segments.

What makes this process even more intriguing is my use of the MoSCo method to prioritize features and issues, categorizing them into Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. This method acts as my strategic advantage, allowing me to make informed decisions and ensuring that essential elements are addressed before exploring finer details, thereby enhancing efficiency.

Ensuring quality is also a priority. I have carefully documented acceptance criteria for each user story, which serve as clear benchmarks for completion, eliminating ambiguity and guaranteeing that every aspect of the project meets my high standards.

To unify these efforts, I have broken each user story down into a series of detailed tasks that are intricately linked to the overall narrative. These tasks act as practical building blocks for execution, providing a clear roadmap for my dedicated development team. They help maintain the structure of the workflow while allowing for an effective division of labor. 
### Note: The issues created for the Pythonista app are available in [this repository](https://github.com/users/LimaZurmati/projects/16). I have linked these issues to a separate React repository specifically focused on front-end development.


## Agile Development Methodology

An agile development approach was documented and tracked using GitHub issues and projects. Each user story was represented as a GitHub issue, labeled to indicate its necessity for the MVP. A GitHub milestone was established to serve as the product backlog, where all user stories were initially listed.

Development was organized into a series of iterations, each with a timebox of three working days, totaling 17 story points. The actual duration of each iteration varied in calendar days due to the need to accommodate work and other commitments.

A GitHub project board was created for each iteration, allowing user stories to be moved from the product backlog into the relevant iteration at the start of each work cycle. User stories were categorized with labels indicating whether they were 'must have', 'could have', or 'should have' for that iteration, along with assigned story point values. Story points for 'must have' user stories were capped at 9 (60%). Some iterations included additional 'tasks' for activities not represented as user stories, such as setup/configuration and design/styling.

A project kanban board was utilized to monitor progress, with user stories transitioning between the 'Todo', 'In Progress', and 'Done' columns as appropriate. For instance, the iteration 2 project board was documented at the beginning, midpoint, and conclusion.

## Design

### Colours
The primary design goal for the Afghansphere app was to achieve a clean and functional aesthetic. The DaisyUI component library was selected for its straightforward color theming feature, enabling the developer to create multiple color themes with a limited palette and semantic class names. This approach aligns perfectly with the desire for a simple and uncluttered user interface.

The colour palette is made up of following colours:
 * rgb(204, 201, 201); - content background-color
 * black - boreder
 * #ffffff - a
 * #2142b2 - a:hover
 * #555 - background
 * rgb(225, 222, 222) - App background

### _Typography_
I used two google fonts for pythonista:
 * **'Open Sans', sans-serif;'** - Sit content

 ## Features


### _Existing Features_
**Navigation Bar**

![NavBar](docs/images/nav.PNG)

The navigation bar includes various clickable links, allowing the user to easily access the pages on the app. The links change according to whether the user is signed in or out, giving them access to more content once signed in.
The links on the navbar are:

* Afghanspere Logo
* Home
* upload Post
* Liked
* User Action (displayed as dropdown menu )
    * Profile
    * Sign Out
* Sign Up
* Sign In

To enhance user navigation, the navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page, remaining visible as users scroll down.

* 
The navigation bar maintains a consistent appearance across all pages, ensuring a uniform experience throughout the app.

A hover effect is included, causing the icons to change to a turquoise color and the cursor to turn into a pointer when hovering over both the text and icons, indicating that they are clickable.

React Bootstrap was utilized to build the navigation bar, ensuring it is fully responsive on all devices.
* **Navbar When users are not loggedIn**

* **Navbar in Tablet's Screen**

    ![Mobile Navbar](docs/images/nav3.PNG)

Home Page ![Home Page](docs/images/hpmepage.PNG) The homepage serves as the initial point of access for users, featuring user posts, a post search function, and options to discover profiles. Each post displays the user's username and profile image, along with the posting date, content, and details of user interactions, such as likes and comment counts.    

* **Post Page**

    ![Post Page](docs/images/postpage.PNG)

    The post page contains further information on the post in question, as well as the homepage version of the post.

    The features here are:

    * Ability to create a comment if logged in.
    * Ability to edit or delete post if you are the owner of the post.
* **Create Post Form**

  ![Create post](docs/images/uploadpost.PNG)  
  Logged-in users can share new posts with the community. By clicking the Create Post icon in the navigation bar, they are directed to the page for submitting a new post, where they can fill out the post creation form to send to the API.

* **Post Edit Form**

  ![Post Edit Form](docs/images/editpost.PNG) 
  When users click on a post, they are taken to the post page. By selecting the "3 dot" button next to the post date, they can access the edit post feature. Clicking "edit" brings up the post creation form, pre-filled with the existing post information. Users can modify the desired fields and save their changes, which will redirect them to the post detail page, confirming that the post has been successfully updated.    
  
Profile Page ![Profile Page](docs/images/profilepage.PNG)
The profile page displays the selected user's informationâ€”either your own via the navigation bar or another userâ€™s by clicking their profile image. It includes the userâ€™s username, profile image, bio, social media links, and statistics such as followers, posts, and events. Additionally, it shows any posts or events created by the user. The only information that gets updated on the profile page includes:
The number of posts the user has published
The number of profiles they are following
The number of profiles that follow them

Edit Profile Page ![Edit Profile Page](docs/images/editprofile.PNG)
By selecting the Edit Profile option, users are taken to a new page with a complete profile details form to fill out and submit. Here, they can upload their avatar image, write a bio, and include links to their GitHub and LinkedIn. Once these fields are completed, they will be visible to other users in the main profile page stats section. Any entered website links can be clicked to open in a new browser tab. Each profile also features a follow button within the stats section, allowing other users to follow or unfollow as needed, since not all profiles are displayed in the popular profiles component.

* **SignUp Page**

    ![SignUp Page](docs/images/sginup.PNG)

    The sign up page is only accessible if the user is logged out. This page consists of a form to be completed in order to sign up and create an account, and a link to the sign in page if the user already has an account.

* **SignIn Page**

    ![SignIn Page](docs/images/sihn.PNG)

    The sign in page is only accessible if the user is logged out. This page consists of a form to be completed in order to sign in, and a link to the sign up page if the user does not yet have an account.



### _Future Implementations_

If there was time after my gratuation I'd like to implement these feature in Pythonista appp and make it more powerfull.

* **Notification System:**
Allow users to recive notification when someone leave a comment on her/his post, event post or add reaction on a post.

* **Messaging System:**
A chat functionality, allowing users to send each other messages, and thus to create stronger connections between like-minded people.
Seeing which users are online including links to the chat page, enabling users to have real-time conversations.

## Deployment



### Steps Before Beployment 

1. Run npm audit fix in the frontend to fix API errors and feedback
2. collect the admin and DRF staticfiles with the followin command in the terminal:
```
  python3 manage.py collectstatic
```
3. compile the React application and move its files to the staticfiles folder. In the terminal, cd into the frontend directory typing:
```
cd frontend
```
4. Run the command to compile and move the React files:
```
  npm run build && mv build ../staticfiles/.
```
**Note:** We need to re-run this command any time you want to deploy changes to the static files in your project, including the React code. To do this, you need to delete the existing build folder and rebuild it. This command will delete the old folder and replace it with the new one:
```
  npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.
```
5. Create a new file in the root directory named runtime.txt
6. Inside the runtime.txt, add the following line: `python-3.9.16`
7. In the `env.py` file, ensure that both the `DEBUG` and `DEV` enviroment varibles are comment out.

8. Run the Django server, in the terminal type: python3 manage.py runserver, then open the preview on `port 8000` to check that your application is runnig. The React server should be not be running. This is a test to check that Django is serving the React static files.

9. Commit and push the changes.

### _Heroku_

1. In your heroku account, select Create New App, and give it a unique name related to your project.
2. Select a region corresponding to where you live and click `Create App`.
3. Head into the `Deploy` tab select GitHub as the `deployment method`, find your project repository and click `Connect`.
4. Click `Deploy branch` to trigger Heroku to start building the application.
5. Once you see the message saying 'build succeeded' you can click `Open App` to see your application in the browser.
